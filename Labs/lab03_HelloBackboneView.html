* Lab 3 - Hello Backbone View
*
* In this lab, we’re going to write a simple Backbone View that just renders
* “Hello Backbone World!” using our HelloWorld model.
*
*  Your mission: Start from the file 3-hello-backbone-view.html. Create a view
* definition in that file that uses the HelloWorld model to render the message.
*
* The view should be rendered on the HTML body of the document
* Don’t forget to add jQuery as a dependency in your HTML scripts section
* Instantiate the view and make sure it renders as expected
