* Lab 4 - License Plate View
*
* In this lab, we’re going to write a simple Backbone View that renders one
* license plate for our store.
*
* Your mission: Start from the file 4-plate-view-and-model.html. Create a view
* definition in that file that uses the LicensePlate model to render it.
*
* The view template is almost ready for you to use: #plate-template
* Complete the template, hook it up to your view and render it!
