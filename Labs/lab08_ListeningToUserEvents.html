* Lab 8 - Listening to User Events
*
* In this lab, we’re going to update our store app so that items can be added
* to the cart.
*
* Your mission: Start from the directory 8-add-to-cart. Create a new model
* CartItem that uses the url: /cart
*
* Register an event so that when the "Add to cart" button of a LicensePlateView
* gets clicked, we create a new CartItem and persist it to the server.
* The CartItem data model will be the same as the one from LicensePlate
*
* Note: You can see the contents of the cart with HTTP GET /cartContents
