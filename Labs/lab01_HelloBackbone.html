* Lab 1 - Hello Backbone
*
* In this lab, we’re going to write a simple Backbone Model definition that
* just says “Hello Backbone World!”
*
* Your mission: Start from the file 1-hello-backbone.html. Create a model
* definition in that file for a HelloWorld model.
*
* That Model should have a helloWorld() method that alerts “Hello message!”
* and the default message should be “Backbone World”
* A custom message can be passed to the model constructor.
* Use the browser console to get / set values of your model and call its
* helloWorld() method
