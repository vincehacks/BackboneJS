* Lab 7 - Fetching Data from a Server
*
* In this lab, we’re going to update our store app to get its data from a
* server.
* First, open a terminal in the server directory of your project. Run npm
* install then node server.js. A REST API now runs on port 8000
* We will use that server to serve our Backbone app as well. Copy-paste both
* app.js and index.html into server/ui
*
* Your mission: Start from the directory 7-fetch-plates. Update our
* collection so that it gets linked to the url: /data
* Then when the main view gets initialized, ask the collection to fetch its
* data.
* You can now remove the hardcoded list of plates from your Javascript code.
