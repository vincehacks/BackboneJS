* Lab 10 - Hello Marionette
*
* In this lab, we’re going to create a simple HelloMarionette app
*
* Your mission: Start from the directory 9-route-to-cart. Create a router
* that has two route definitions: /store and /cart
* /store will display the current view with all of the store items
* /cart should only render the items in the cart, using the same HTML
* #container
* Update the navigation links at the top of the webpage to easily navigate
* between these two views
