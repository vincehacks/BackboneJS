* Lab 6 - Using Handlebars
*
* In this lab, we’re going to update our store app to use Handlebar templates.
*
* Your mission: Start from the directory 6-handlebar-template. First
* update index.html to turn our template into a Handlebars template
* Then update app.js to make the LicensePlateView use Handlebars
*
* Hint: The code you have to write is very similar to the one we saw in the\
* previous slides - also feel free to browse http://handlebarsjs.com/ for more
* information on how to use Handlebars
