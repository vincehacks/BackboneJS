* Lab 5 - A Collection of License Plates
*
* In this lab, we’re going to write a simple Backbone app that uses a
* collection to render a list of license plates for our store.
*
* Your mission: Start from the directory 5-collection-plates. Our code is now
* split in two files: index.html and app.js.
*
* Create a collection object and an application view to render it, using the
* provided plates array.
* The collection of plates should be renderer in the #container div
* 
* Hint: The code you have to write is very similar to the one we saw in the
* previous slides
