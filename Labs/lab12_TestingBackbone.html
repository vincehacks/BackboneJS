* Lab 12 - Testing Backbone
*
* In this lab, we’re going to write a couple of tests.
*
* Your mission: Start from the directory jasmine-2.8.0. Use SpecRunner.html to
* see the sample tests in action.
* Then create your own test spec that will mock the fetch method of our
* collection to return two fake license plate instead (you can get that data
* from one of our early labs)
* Then make sure that the CollectionView will have two LicensePlate models to
* render, and that the data from those models is what we expect (same title,
* same picture, etc.)
